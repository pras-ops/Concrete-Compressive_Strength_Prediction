# Project Title: Predicting Concrete Compressive Strength using Machine Learning Techniques
## Introduction
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering, and its compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. In this project, our main aim is to predict the correct concrete compressive strength using machine learning techniques. We will utilize the information on various ingredients to predict the different cement compressive strengths.

## Ingredients
The ingredients considered for predicting the concrete compressive strength are:

1. Cement
2. Blast furnace slag
3. Fly ash
4. Water
5. Superplasticizer
6. Coarse aggregate
7. Fine aggregate
8. Methodology

## We will utilize the following steps in our project:

- Data Analysis: Analyzing the provided dataset to gain insights into the data distribution, identifying patterns, and understanding the relationships between variables.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for further analysis. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and transforming variables if necessary.
- Feature Engineering: Selecting and engineering relevant features from the given ingredients information to improve the model's predictive performance.
- Model Building using DL: Employing the Keras Sequential model to train and evaluate our machine learning model for predicting the concrete compressive strength.
